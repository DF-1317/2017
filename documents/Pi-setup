when starting out with a new sim card [which is the disk drive of the Pi]
you need to download and overlay an img file. Download from:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
Once unzipped, follow the instructions here:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md

The first time you boot on the sim, there is some setup of various things.
- sudo bash, then change the password of the pi user; something easy to remember
- change the keyboard to US English via Preferences -> Mouse and Keyboard Settings
- activate ssh via Preferences -> Raspberry Pi Configuration -> Interfaces

To make login from your laptop easier, copy over your public key
- first on the pi, mkdir .ssh
- on the laptop, scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@<ip>:.ssh/authorized_keys
- on the pi, chmod 700 .ssh
Now try an ssh pi@<ip> [accept the key signature on first login].
If more than one user want access, append their public key to the
authorized_keys file.

Need to load and build some software.
[as of this writting, the pi was loaded with Raspian, based on Debian Jessie]

If you are doing vision work with OpenCV and Python, here are the many
steps to getting to your goal.
If you need to build from source, like opencv, I like to install things
in my home area. This usually means 1 or two extra parameters and maybe
some loging environment setup step. All are listed here.
I followed the steps, more or less, from:
http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/
- ssh into the pi  # get terminal access to the pi
- sudo bash        # become the root user for a few commands
- apt-get update   # refresh the list of what software is available
- apt-get upgrade  # update the pi to the latest and greatest
- apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config
- apt-get install htop  # nice tool to view system status
- ...etc...
- wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
- python get-pip.py
- pip install imutils
- get and build ffmpeg

Configuring your programs to startup when the pi boots up.
